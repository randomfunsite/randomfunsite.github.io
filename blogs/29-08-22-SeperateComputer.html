        <p>Github is amazing. I am on another computer as of now and am still able to change this. Granted, I need to be on my main account, as I forgot how to sign in to the RFS Webmaster account, but I can just add a pull request, sign in for real on RandomFunSite, and accept the changes! I am going to give the DevBadger account Write Access so it doesn't matter which account I'm on, I can just always change it. And even if it doesn't work or my account gets compromised, I can just sign back in and rollback the changes. Github is also amazing as it has great source control!</p>
