    <h1>The Future of RFS</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h5>Published 28/08/22 by DevBadger</h5>
    <p>Recently, RFS (Random Fun Site) has gone through some changes. I'm not planning to make it look like a profesional site though. What I want out of RFS is a little place where I can just put whatever I want, wherever I want. I don't want it to look bad (that's why I changed the font), but I want it to look... homemade. Reflecting how I develop it, I want it to look like some random dude's just coding away. In fact, I am writing this blog directly in code. Will I, in the future develop a tool for generating this? If I decide I want to blog a lot. Otherwise, I'm just gonna write barebones code. - DevBadger</p>
